            <p>
              Mobile contractors face many challenges in collecting,
              transporting, and disposing of wastewater compared to other types
              of businesses. This study reports the Dump Smart Program that took
              place in Eastern Washington cities in 2010. The City of Wenatchee
              as the lead agency, partnered with other cities and counties in
              Eastern Washington targeted mobile contractors in six eastern
              Washington communities. The goal of this study was to assess the
              effectiveness of the Dump Smart education and outreach program in
              eastern Washington for carpet cleaning contractors. The
              effectiveness of the program was evaluated based on the number of
              businesses who were disposing wastewater in accordance with the
              "Dump Smart Tips for Properly Handling Waste Water when Carpet
              Cleaning" and how many businesses were carrying spill kits.

              The evaluation method compared responses from the test population
              to the control population to determine if there was a significance
              in waste water disposal practices and spill preparedness between
              the two groups. Carpet cleaning businesses in test and control
              jurisdictions were surveyed, as well as mobile contractors. Action
              Research was hired to conduct the surveys and provide statistical
              analyses. The company conducted a pilot test in the City of
              Pullman to validate the survey instrument for mobile contractors
              and jurisdictions. Following the validation, postcards were sent
              to carpet cleaning businesses by the City of Wenatchee to assure
              respondents that they would not be receiving a scam or
              telemarketing. The company administered the surveys to mobile
              contractors and carpet cleaning businesses in test and control
              areas. There were total 83 carpet cleaning businesses in the test
              and control groups, and only 16 completed the phone surveys.
              Statistical analyses couldn't be performed due to the limited
              number of responses. The limited number of responses was due in
              part to a high volume of wrong, disconnected, and out of business
              phone numbers. For example, different websites would have
              different phone numbers for the same business, and carpet cleaning
              vans would also display different phone numbers from their
              websites.

              Statistical analyses couldn't be performed due to the limited
              number of responses. Nonetheless, the business survey provided
              some information about carpet cleaning businesses in the test and
              control areas and the effectiveness of the Dump Smart program.
              Most of the businesses, 81% (13 of 16) responded that they had a
              spill kit in all of their vehicles. With respect to wastewater
              disposal practices, the data and results were not straightforward.
              For example, the businesses in both the test and control area were
              primarily discharging wastewater to drains. It was unclear in at
              least three of the responses whether the drain was connected to a
              municipal stormwater system or sewer.
