              This document contains the results of a phone survey that was
              conducted in October 2011 of the attitudes and behaviors of Kitsap
              Peninsula's residents, which includes residents in Kitsap County
              and the City of Gig Harbor. The objective of the survey was to
              track changes made since the 2008 benchmark survey and gain a
              better understanding of how local and regional stormwater outreach
              programs influence residential awareness, activities and
              behaviors.

              Phone surveys were conducted via landline and cell phone from
              October 10th to October 26th, 2011. Pacific Market Research used a
              computer assisted telephone survey (CATI) system for landlines.
              Cell phones were dialed manually in accordance with FCC
              regulations. There were 802 completed telephone interviews, 75% of
              which were landline. The collected survey data were weighted by
              age and geographic subarea so that the survey was more of a
              reflection of the Kitsap Peninsula population. The survey study
              was designed to serve three purposes: 1) tracked changes made
              since the 2008 survey 2) examined which educational outreach
              programs are the most effective 3) provided individual
              jurisdictions with information about their residents and how they
              compared to the study area and among each other.{" "}

              The survey indicated that there were positive and negative results
              when compared to the 2008 study. With respect to using lawn care
              products, the use of chemical fertilizer decreased by 31%-36%, the
              use of weed and feed decreased by 14%-16%, and the use of
              pesticides decreased by 47%-58%. Howeveer, the use of organic or
              slow-release fertilize decreased by 12%. Best managent practices
              (BMPs) associated with yard waste also had mixed results. For
              example, the percentage of people who reported composting on their
              property increased 8%, but those who recycled yard waste decreased
              by 10%. The percentage of people who left dog waste on the ground
              most of them when walking their dog decreased by 6%. The
              percentage of people who were more likely to take their vehicle to
              a shop for service increased by 6%. Finally, the percentage of
              people who reported washing their car at home was 17% higher in
              2011 than 2008.
