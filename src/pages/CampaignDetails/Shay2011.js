              Austin, Texas, participated in a 319(h) nonpoint source pollution
              prevention grant with the Texas Commission on Environmental
              Quality (TCEQ). The grant-funded program aimed to persuade
              homeowners to reduce the use of lawn and garden chemicals by
              promoting earth-wise landscaping methods.

            <p>
              Homeowners in the middle to high socio-economic group because they
              are most likely to have funds to purchase landscape chemicals. In
              addition, the research team also included information from the
              fertilizer company Scotts/Miracle Gro. As a result, the target
              audience also included men of 55 years old and older who value
              green and well-manicured lawn, homeowners who were in their 30s
              searching for first-time device on landscaping techniques and had
              not yet developed less earth-wide habits, and women who were
              purchasing or influencing more than 50% of fertilizer purchases.

              pollution reduction was assessed with direct monitoring of
              groundwater springs and stormwater runoff. The monitoring

              The success of educational outreach was measured in the pilot
              neighborhoods with before-and-after education surveys.
              Additionally, assessments on pollution reduction were conducted by
              directly monitoring groundwater springs and stormwater runoff. The
              majority of neigborhoods surveyed showed a positive behavior
              response to education and indicated a decrease in chemical
              fertilizer use, but not all findings were statistically
              significant. For example, the use of chemical fertilizer decreased
              by 5%, the use of weed-and-feed decreased by 10%, the use of
              organic fertilizer increased by 13%, and the use of slow release
              fertilizer increased by 4%. However, only the increase in the use
              of organic fertilizer was statistically significant. Results from
              monitoring data reported that pesticide Carbaryl was not detected
              in any sample. Potential changes from education as observed in
              monitoring data were mixed. For example, ammonia decreased at four
              of five sites in the post-education time period; nitrate
              concentrations increased at two sites and decreased at one site.
              Additionally, there were no differences in the peak concentrations
              of Atrazine pre- or post-education but this may be confounded by
              the different weather conditions. There was more rainfall during
              the post-education period, which could have resulted in additional
              lawn care activities, education notwithstanding.{" "}
